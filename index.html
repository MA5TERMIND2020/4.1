    <h2>The encoding of pixel location on a web browser is very similar to the 4th quadrant of a cortesean plane.<br>
        The only difference is that the Y-values are inverted. The origin (0,0) is located in the top-left corner of<br>
        the window and as the X value increases, the location of the pixel being referenced moves to<br>
        the right. But as the Y value increases, the location of the pixel being referenced moves<br>
        down. This web page provides a good way to visualize this by allowing you to see the<br>
        coordinate point values displayed on the screen in real time<br>
        as an image is moved across the screen.</h2>
